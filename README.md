# Recombinase

The library at `src/DNA.hs` implements an interesting DNA operation that I
learned about last year on [Scott Aaronson's blog][1]. It makes use of an
incredibly interesting approach I found for implementing the [KMP Search
Algorithm in Haskell][2].

Interesting stuff! Stay tuned for more tales of interest!
